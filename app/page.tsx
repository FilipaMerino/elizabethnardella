              Therapy comes in many forms, and not every approach fits everyone.
              I specialize in <strong>Somatic Therapy</strong>, which focuses on
              the <strong>connection</strong> between <strong>mind</strong> and{' '}
              <strong>body</strong>. We will use mindful movement and body
              awareness to help you work through your emotions comfortably and
              effectively.
            </p>
            <p className='text-sm italic'>
              If you feel like this approach resonates with you, book your
              session. Let's start this beautiful journey together.
